                    We all know how important writing is. It gives you your world of
                    freedom. You can shape any world any sentence the way you want.
                    Using Sketches, pencils, etc you can draw the world enumerating
                    your creativity. But What do you think, do underprivileged children
                    feel this freedom?<br>SDF team initiated the mission to distribute stationery to these
                    children. It will add wings to their thoughts. First, SDF distributed
                    stationery to children who come to Shashi Pathshala. The programme
                    went well and impressed by this; nearby schools also approached the
                    SDF team to distribute stationery items in their school. The first
                    event held at Z P School on 1 July 2019. Here, surprisingly the ratio
                    of students was very less, despite having good infrastructure. School
                    authorities told these little kid’s families usually do small scale work
                    like daily wage working, farming. They hardly manage to afford
                    amenities for their children. Therefore, most of them even prefer
                    not to send them to school. The programme was attended by the
                    Headmaster of school, who himself is a social activist. He appreciated
                    the SDF team’s work. Consequently, we reached other schools also to
                    contribute our part to their education.</p>

                    On 25 Dec 2018, the SDF team packed their bags and headed to the
                    village Belona which is in a district of Nagpur. When they reached
                    the destination and opened their magical bags, the crowd of little
                    naïve children gathered around. When they showed them the books
                    with colorful pictures and texts, their hearts delighted. And you
                    should see the smile on their little faces after receiving them as gifts.
                    Those smiles were impeccable. This small step was appreciated by
                    the village people also.<br>SDF team will look forward to such events to bring a smile on

                While the world struggling with the worst pandemic of the century,
                there is a section of society who is facing one more calamity i.e.
                hunger. The world is under lockdown, no work is taking place, no
                livelihood can be earned. People like you and me can afford this
                lockdown as we get salaries and we do have enough stock of food
                which can sustain us for months. But for people whose hearth lit
                only when he earns money for that day. For how many days will they
                sleep empty stomach? Still, they can but it will be a heart-wrenching
                situation for them to see their kids with no food for days. For them,
                this lockdown situation is not less than hell, where they will starve to
                death. For them, COVID-19 is not scarier but hunger is. By realizing the
                need of the hour, the govt. India is taking initiatives to take care of
                their food and money. But will the govt. be able to sustain these
                people (22% population of India) along with dealing emergency of
                COVID-19? Here, the nation needs us, these people require our help.<br><br>This time also, with no surprise SDF team came forward to take the
                responsibility. As this task require way more efforts and funds, SDF
                collaborated with Mitti Ke Rang NGO to cover this drive-in Katol.
                The aim was to transfer money to their accounts and help them with
                daily food necessities. SDF reached 1000 families, who were daily
                wage workers, maids, labourers, vendors, construction workers,
                etc. Their livelihood was earned on a daily earning basis. SDF team
                arranged a fund for groceries like rice, sugar, etc. for these people.
                The team with abiding guidelines of WHO and govt., wearing face
                masks, and hand sanitized packed their bags to reach these people
                as Lifesavers. Successfully, On 4th April 2020, the team was able to
                accomplish its mission. They distributed the groceries to the families
                which can help them to sustain for about 21 days. SDF team also
                make them aware of the situation of the country and ask them to
                not risk their lives. SDF team will be always available whenever
                they require any help. SDF team also ask them to take precautionary
                measure to fight against this pandemic and in any health emergency,
                they must seek medical help.</p>

                                To make an effort in the direction to help children grow, the
                                Shashi Dream Foundation team came up with an idea to
                                organize quiz in different schools and at a different level.
                                The motive of the team behind organizing quiz was to make
                                this young generation realize the importance of textbooks they
                                are studying. These books are not just a compilation of paper
                                rather they are an elixir for their bright future.<br><br>Now the question in front of them was where to organize?
                                They chose three schools which do not come under the City
                                Council. The schools were Keshav Rao Pawar School,
                                Government School, and Katol High School. The SDF team
                                met school authorities and proposed their idea to organize a
                                quiz with the help of their team and everything from quiz paper
                                to pen will be arranged by SDF only. And school authorities gave
                                a positive response to the proposal.</p>
